                                    Simple, streamlined procurement of human tissue samples — it&apos;s possible with CBRS. Whether you need fully released FFPE blocks with specific variant profiles, archived samples, or prospectively collected diseased tissue over time with matched quad sets, we take care of the procurement so you get your bio specimens.
                                    As we have access to the complete electronic patient record, we can select and annotate samples with molecular and genetic characterizations, treatment data, outcome data, and other relevant patient and specimen data.
                                    Let us know which tissue samples you need and we will tap into our global network of bio specimen providers.

                                    <b>Fresh Tissue :</b>
                                    CBRS&apos;s extensive network provides access to high-quality fresh tissue country wide, providing the diversity of samples and patients needed in today’s research.
                                    Let our sample experts help you determine the feasibility of your fresh tissue request while exploring reliable alternatives so your research doesn&apos;t stall.
                                    Throughout our network, tissue samples are collected under IRB-approved protocols, using processes to ensure consistency and quality. All samples are collected in full compliance with regulatory standards and best practice guidelines.

                                    <b>Frozen Human Tissue :</b>
                                    Access to viable cryopreserved human tissue from healthy, normal, and Diseased donors
                                    It&apos;s no secret. Obtaining fresh tissue can be very difficult and unpredictable. A reliable alternative it is very similar to obtaining fresh surgical tissue, but offers added flexibility and immediate availability, can help you keep your research projects on track. CBRS helps you procure viable cryopreserved and frozen tissue.
                                    Viable cryopreserved tissue (or fresh frozen tissue) is designed to be a suitable substitute for fresh tissue after thawing and can be used in a variety of ways, including live cell assays, genomic analysis, flow cytometers, and more. Cryopreserved tissue also retains tissue heterogeneity and often contains cancer stem cells and tumors infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).

                                    <b>Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Tissue :</b>
                                    The access to a global repository of FFPE tissue from diseased and healthy patients. (Donor) A large, diversified repository of FFPE tissue samples from our extensive provider network gives you access to high-quality FFPE tissue blocks from hundreds of repositories worldwide, reflecting the sample and patient diversity that modern medical research requires. Throughout our network, FFPE tissue samples are collected under IRB-approved protocols, using processes to ensure consistency and quality. All samples are collected in full compliance with regulatory standards and best practice guidelines. Check out our inventory of archived FFPE blocks that have been released for research with a consent form These tissue samples are highly versatile and support research in areas such as oncology, hematology, and immunology— - especially for replication, validation, and immune histochemical (IHC) testing.
