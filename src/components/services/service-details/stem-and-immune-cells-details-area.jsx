                                    CBRS Research offers hematologic tissue containing hematopoietic stem and immune cells prospectively collected from U.S. donors following US CFR and IRB requirements. The marketplace offers more choices for donor characteristics such as blood type, HLA type, body mass index (BMI), gender, age, race, ethnicity, and smoking (tobacco, vape, or THC). Donors are screened for medications, lifestyle, and medical history, and tested for HBV, HCV, HIV, and serology tests at a minimum, with the option to test for an expanded spectrum of infectious diseases.
