                                    Gain access to a growing network of providers for fresh and cryopreserved hematology samples from a large collective population of healthy and diagnosed donors.
                                    CBRS offers hematologic tissue containing hematopoietic stem and immune cells prospectively collected from India following ICMR and IRB guidelines. The services offers more choices for donor characteristics such as blood type, HLA type, body mass index (BMI), gender, age, race, ethnicity, and smoking (tobacco, vape, or THC). Donors are screened for medications, lifestyle, and medical history, and tested for HBV, HCV, HIV, and serology tests at a minimum, with the option to test for an expanded spectrum of infectious diseases.
