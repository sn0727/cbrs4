                <p>There are several aspects to consider when storing samples, such as sample traceability, laboratory equipment, and storage temperature. We discuss the different storage temperatures, short- and long-term storage of samples, which lab equipment is useful at which temperatures, and which vessel sizes to consider.</p>
                <h4 className="tp-srv-stap__title mb-25">VARIOUS STORAGE TEMPERATURES</h4>
                <p>Based on how long the sample needs to be stored and what kind of sample you are keeping, it is essential to know at which temperature the sample will best be preserved. Samples can be stored at ambient temperature (+20°C), in the refrigerator (+4°C), in the freezer (-20°C), in the ultra-low freezer (-80°C), or in cryo tanks (-190°C and lower). Most long-term storage happens in the ultra-low freezer or cryo tank. The other options are used for short-term storage. Exceptions can be made when, for example, tissue is preserved in a fixative solution like paraffin wax.</p>

                  At CBRS, we fully understand the importance of seamless customer integration and as a result, we offer advanced solutions to facilitate effective communication and data management. By creating application programming interfaces (APIs), we create direct communication channels between our information systems and customers. So, once their sample is analyzed or processed, our systems automatically generate real-time notifications that give customers instant updates on the progress of their samples. This level of transparency and assurance ensures that samples are processed and stored within the agreed time frame. In addition, we provide data feeds to clients that deliver summary test results or store data directly to them. These data streams provide full transparency and allow customers to stay informed about their sample results and specific registration data.

This allows us to store data and create custom dashboards that provide customers with advanced information about the status of  samples throughout their processing and storage lifecycle. With these interactive dashboards, we provide end-to-end visibility and transparency, allowing customers to gain a complete understanding of the progress and status of their samples.

                  We understand the importance of flexibility in data management, especially when it comes to sample expiration or sample disqualification, with our laboratory data management system and LIMS and cloud systems are designed to automatically email customers when sample data is deleted. This proactive approach gives customers peace of mind and ensures that their data has been processed and removed from our systems according to their requirements.
