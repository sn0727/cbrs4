                                    <b>Client Integration and data management : </b>
                                    At CBRS, we fully understand the importance of seamless customer integration and as a result, we offer advanced solutions to facilitate effective communication and data management. By creating application programming interfaces (APIs), we create direct communication channels between our information systems and customers. So, once their sample is analyzed or processed, our systems automatically generate real-time notifications that give customers instant updates on the progress of their samples. This level of transparency and assurance ensures that samples are processed and stored within the agreed time frame. In addition, we provide data feeds to clients that deliver summary test results or store data directly to them. These data streams provide full transparency and allow customers to stay informed about their sample results and specific registration data.

                                    For customers who prefer cloud-based storage solutions, especially those who process clinical data, we have a robust and secure cloud system. This allows us to store data and create custom dashboards that provide customers with advanced information about the status of samples throughout their processing and storage lifecycle. With these interactive dashboards, we provide end-to-end visibility and transparency, allowing customers to gain a complete understanding of the progress and status of their samples.

                                    We understand the importance of flexibility in data management, especially when it comes to sample expiration or sample disqualification, with our laboratory data management system and LIMS and cloud systems are designed to automatically email customers when sample data is deleted. This proactive approach gives customers peace of mind and ensures that their data has been processed and removed from our systems according to their requirements.

Our goal is to equip customers with the tools and information they need to stay informed and make informed decisions about their samples and data, ensuring a seamless and reliable experience throughout their collaboration.
